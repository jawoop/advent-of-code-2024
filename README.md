Advent of Code 2024, but I spin a wheel to see what language I program in!

Here's the list of languages I'm picking from.

| Language | Previous experience |
| --- | --- |
| APL | tried for an hour |
| awk | none |
| C | I know what I'm doing, but I know it's not good |
| C# | basically none |
| C++ | I sort of know what I'm doing |
| Clojure | none |
| D | none |
| Elixir | tried for an hour |
| F# | none |
| Go | none |
| Haskell | basically none |
| Java | somewhat proficient |
| JavaScript | I know what I'm doing, but I don't know how good it is |
| Julia | tried for an hour |
| Kotlin | tried for an hour |
| Lua | tried a long time ago |
| OCaml | none |
| Octave | none |
| Perl | none |
| PHP | tried a long time ago |
| Python | proficient! |
| Racket | none |
| Raku | none |
| Ruby | learned about 10 years ago, I don't remember most of it |
| Rust | I know what I'm doing, but I don't know how good it is |
| Scala | tried for an hour |
| Scheme | none |
| Swift | none |
| TypeScript | learned some for a class, I'm not proficient |
| Visual Basic .NET | none |
| Zig | tried for an hour |

I tried to pick languages that are used in the industry today. My sources were the TIOBE index supplemented with [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type). From the TIOBE index, I did not include FORTRAN or Delphi Object-Pascal because those look extremely difficult. Some of these are in here for a challenge (Haskell, awk, etc.), but I let myself have Python for one easy\* day. 
_(\*Python does not make everything easy.)_

I will include Markdown writeups in each day's folder describing my experience with the problem. I think of them like blog posts *Ã  la* [fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me/).

Without further ado, let's get started!
